# When you run your application and PostgreSQL database on your local machine (outside of Docker), 
# they can both access localhost (or 127.0.0.1) to communicate with each other, as they are on the same host.
# However, when you run each of these services in separate Docker containers, localhost within the message_board_app container refers to the container itself, 
# not to the host machine or any other container. This isolation is a core feature of Docker, designed to encapsulate each container in its own network namespace.
